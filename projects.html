            <p>Welcome to my personal gallery celebrating the <em>incredible heroes</em> of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This collection showcases my favorite characters from the Infinity Saga—the founding Avengers who risked everything to protect Earth and the universe from threats beyond imagination. Each of these heroes represents different aspects of what it means to be <em>truly heroic</em>: courage, sacrifice, leadership, and the willingness to stand up when it matters most.</p>
            <p>From billionaire genius to super-soldier to Norse god, these characters have inspired millions around the world. Their journeys from flawed individuals to legendary heroes demonstrate that greatness isn't about perfection—it's about growth, redemption, and <em>never giving up</em>, no matter the odds.</p>

            <h2>Iron Man - The Genius Who Started It All</h2>

            <h3>Character Profile: Tony Stark</h3>
            <p>Tony Stark, the brilliant billionaire industrialist, transformed from a weapons manufacturer with a massive ego into the hero who would ultimately save the universe. His journey began in a cave in Afghanistan, where he built the first Iron Man suit to escape captivity. What started as a means of survival became a mission to protect the world from the weapons he had created.</p>

            <p>Throughout the MCU, Tony evolved from a self-centered playboy to a mentor, leader, and father figure. His relationship with Peter Parker showcased his growth, as he took responsibility for shaping the next generation of heroes. Tony's arc culminated in Avengers: Endgame, where he made the ultimate sacrifice, proving that the man who had everything was willing to give it all up for others. His snap that defeated Thanos wasn't just about power—it was the completion of a hero's journey that began with selfishness and ended with the most selfless act imaginable.</p>

            <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong> "I am Iron Man" - The words that defined his character from beginning to end, representing his refusal to hide behind a mask and his acceptance of responsibility for his actions.</p>

            <h2>Captain America - The First Avenger</h2>
            <img src="images/captain.png" alt="Captain America wielding his iconic vibranium shield" class="project-image">

            <h3>Character Profile: Steve Rogers</h3>
            <p>Steve Rogers represents the best of humanity—not because of the super-soldier serum that enhanced his physical abilities, but because of the man he already was before the transformation. As Dr. Erskine said, "The serum amplifies everything that is inside, so good becomes great; bad becomes worse." Steve's unwavering moral compass, his refusal to compromise his principles, and his willingness to sacrifice himself for others made him the perfect choice for the serum.</p>

            <p>Frozen for 70 years, Steve woke up in a world that had moved on without him. Despite this displacement, he became the heart and soul of the Avengers, always fighting for what he believed was right, even when it meant standing against his own government or his fellow Avengers. His conflict with Tony Stark in Civil War showcased the complexity of his character—he wasn't blindly following orders but thinking critically about freedom and responsibility.</p>

            <p>Steve's final act in Endgame, choosing to live the life he'd sacrificed decades ago, was the perfect conclusion to his story. After spending his entire life putting others first, he finally chose happiness for himself. His passing of the shield to Sam Wilson represented not just a transfer of power, but the acknowledgment that Captain America is more than one man—it's an ideal that can inspire anyone to be their best self.</p>

        <!-- Project 3: Thor -->
        <article id="thor-project" class="project">
            <h2>Thor - The God of Thunder</h2>
            <img src="images/thor.png" alt="Thor the mighty Asgardian wielding lightning powers" class="project-image">

            <h3>Character Profile: Thor Odinson</h3>
            <p>Thor's journey is one of the most transformative in the MCU, taking him from an arrogant prince to a wise and humble king. Initially believing that his power came from his hammer Mjolnir and his royal birthright, Thor had to learn that true strength comes from within. His banishment to Earth by his father Odin was the first step in understanding that being worthy isn't about power or privilege—it's about humility, compassion, and sacrifice.</p>

            <p>Throughout the Infinity Saga, Thor faced unimaginable loss. He lost his mother, his father, his brother Loki (multiple times), his hammer, his home planet of Asgard, and half of his people. In Infinity War, despite his new weapon Stormbreaker and his attack on Thanos, he failed to prevent the snap, leading to immense guilt and depression. Thor's struggle with PTSD and survivor's guilt in Endgame was a powerful portrayal of how even gods can be broken by trauma.</p>

            <p>What makes Thor's story so compelling is his resilience. Despite all his losses and failures, he found the strength to keep fighting. The moment when he summoned Mjolnir in Endgame and realized he was "still worthy" was emotionally powerful because it represented his journey of self-forgiveness and acceptance. Thor learned that worthiness isn't about being perfect—it's about getting back up after you fall and continuing to fight for what's right.</p>

        <!-- Project 4: The Original Trinity -->
        <article id="trinity-project" class="project">
            <h2>The Original Trinity - A Legacy of Heroes</h2>
            <img src="images/cap, thor and ironman.png" alt="Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man standing together as the core Avengers" class="project-image">

            <h3>The Heart of the Avengers</h3>
            <p>While all the Avengers are remarkable, the trinity of Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor forms the emotional and thematic core of the Infinity Saga. These three represent different aspects of heroism: Tony represents human ingenuity and redemption, Steve represents moral integrity and sacrifice, and Thor represents divine power tempered by humility. Together, they embody what the Avengers stand for—individuals from vastly different backgrounds united by a common purpose.</p>

            <p>Their relationships with each other evolved dramatically throughout the saga. From initial conflicts and clashing egos to mutual respect and brotherhood, watching these three heroes grow together has been one of the MCU's greatest achievements. The scene in Age of Ultron where they attempt to lift Thor's hammer foreshadows the trust and worthiness that would become central to their story. In Endgame, when Cap wields Mjolnir in battle, it's not just a spectacular moment—it's the culmination of years of character development and earned heroism.</p>

            <p>The legacy of the original trinity extends beyond their individual stories. Tony mentored Peter Parker and inspired a generation of technological heroes. Steve passed his shield and ideals to Sam Wilson, ensuring that Captain America would continue to inspire. Thor found his purpose in protecting those in need, wherever they may be. Their influence shaped the entire MCU and set the standard for what it means to be an Avenger.</p>

            <p><strong>Epic Moment:</strong> The scene in Avengers: Endgame where Thor, wielding Stormbreaker, teams up with Cap holding Mjolnir and Tony in his nanotech armor to face Thanos represents the perfect union of their powers and the culmination of over a decade of storytelling.</p>

        <!-- Project 5: The Epic Final Battle -->
        <article id="final-battle-project" class="project">
            <h2>The Battle for the Universe</h2>
            <img src="images/war.png" alt="Heroes assembled for the climactic final battle" class="project-image">

            <h3>Avengers: Endgame - The Conclusion of an Era</h3>
            <p>The final battle in Avengers: Endgame represents the culmination of 11 years and 22 films of storytelling. When Captain America stands alone against Thanos's entire army, tightening his shield strap in defiance, it embodies everything the MCU has built—one hero's unwavering determination against impossible odds. The moment Sam's voice crackles through the comm with "On your left," followed by the portals opening to reveal every hero returning for one last fight, is perhaps the most cathartic moment in blockbuster cinema history.</p>

            <p>This battle wasn't just about spectacular visual effects or epic action sequences—though it delivered both in abundance. It was about seeing characters we'd grown to love over years finally united for a common purpose. Watching Black Panther, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Scarlet Witch, and countless others charge into battle alongside the original Avengers was the payoff for over a decade of interconnected storytelling. Each hero had their moment, from Scarlet Witch nearly defeating Thanos single-handedly to Spider-Man desperately protecting the gauntlet to Captain Marvel's dramatic arrival.</p>

            <p>The battle's conclusion, with Tony Stark's ultimate sacrifice, brought the Infinity Saga full circle. The man who began this journey as someone who "wouldn't make the sacrifice play" ended it by giving everything to save the universe. His final words—"I am Iron Man"—mirrored the words that started the MCU in 2008, creating a perfect bookend to an epic story. This wasn't just the end of a battle; it was the end of an era and the completion of one of cinema's greatest character arcs.</p>
