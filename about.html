            <img src="images/Infinity war.png" alt="Marvel Avengers assembled for Infinity War" class="section-image">

            <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. Beginning with Iron Man in 2008, the MCU has grown into one of the most successful and ambitious film franchises in cinema history. What makes the MCU truly special is its interconnected storytelling approach, where each film contributes to a larger narrative tapestry that spans multiple phases and years.</p>

            <p>The franchise is organized into distinct phases, with the first three phases collectively known as "The Infinity Saga," culminating in the epic two-part finale of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. These films brought together characters and storylines that had been developing for over a decade, creating an unprecedented cinematic event. The MCU has introduced audiences to a diverse array of heroes, from billionaire genius Tony Stark to the god of thunder Thor, from the super-soldier Steve Rogers to the mystical Doctor Strange.</p>

            <p>Beyond the theatrical releases, the MCU has expanded to include Disney+ series that dive deeper into character development and introduce new heroes to the fold. These series, including WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and Loki, have proven that the MCU's storytelling prowess extends seamlessly to the small screen. The franchise continues to evolve with Phase 4 and beyond, exploring themes of legacy, identity, and the multiverse while introducing the next generation of heroes.</p>

            <p>What distinguishes the MCU from other superhero franchises is its commitment to character development alongside spectacular action sequences. Each hero undergoes meaningful growth throughout their journey, facing personal demons, moral dilemmas, and impossible choices. The franchise balances humor with heart, delivering moments of levity while not shying away from emotional depth and genuine stakes. This combination has created a loyal fanbase worldwide and has influenced the landscape of modern blockbuster filmmaking.</p>

            <h2>Why I Love the MCU</h2>
            <img src="images/cap, thor and ironman.png" alt="The original Avengers trinity - Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man" class="section-image">

            <p>As a fan since the beginning, I've been captivated by how the MCU has <em>revolutionized</em> storytelling in cinema. It's not just about the spectacular visual effects or the epic battles—though those are certainly impressive. What <em>truly</em> resonates with me is the humanity at the core of every story. These films remind us that heroes aren't defined by their powers, but by their choices and their willingness to sacrifice for others.</p>

            <p>The MCU has given us characters who feel real and relatable despite their extraordinary circumstances. We've watched Tony Stark transform from a selfish playboy to a selfless hero willing to make the <em>ultimate sacrifice</em>. We've seen Steve Rogers struggle with a world that has moved on without him, yet never compromise his principles. We've witnessed Thor lose everything and discover that true strength comes from within, not from a hammer or a title.</p>
